# React random color generator

This application written with React will show a random color when the button `Generate` is clicked.

## Features

Select hue

Select lightness

Smooth color transition

Set size of the color box

Button that makes the box bounce around the screen

## Libraries used:

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh) and [randomColor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/randomcolor)
TODOS:
[ ] - Make a "screensaver mode" where the color box moves around in a diagonal pattern, bouncing off the screen edges and changing color
[ ] - Fix box not bouncing off screen edges properly
[ ] - implement changing color within animation keyframes
[ ] - use Emotion for all styling, currently only partly implemented
