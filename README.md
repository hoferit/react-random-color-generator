# React random color generator

This application written with React will show a random color when a button is clicked.

##

red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink and monochrome are accepted strings for hue

bright, light or dark are accepted strings for luminousity
Goal:
A button with the exact text Generate will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text Generated Color: <background color hex code> (the background color and the hex code must match)

TODOS:
[x] - Setup Project
[x] - Create Page Layout with Generate button
[ ] - Features needed:
[x] - Find library to generate color
[x] - implement randomcolor npm package
[x] - ask for hue and luminosity (used choice variant instead of passing strings-error-handling)
[x] - smooth color transitions
[x] - use emotion css in js library
[x] - ask for a size for the color box and generate a box of that size
[ ] - Make a "screensaver mode" where the color box moves around in a diagonal pattern, bouncing off the screen edges and changing color
